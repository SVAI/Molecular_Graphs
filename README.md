# Pathway inhibitor for preventing NF2 tumor growth
## Team: Paranoid Androids

### Hypothesis
- Can we intercept PTK2 or HSP90 pathways to slow down or stop NF2 tumor growth?

### Background
- Typically the NF2 gene creates a protein called Merlin that acts as a tumor inhibitor by inhibiting several pathways such as Src/Fak, Ras/Rac/PAK, and mTOR functions
- However in NF2 disorder patients mutations in the gene cause the protein produced to be shortened or dysfunctional in other aspects which is thus unable to inhibit these pathways and leads to tumors

### Our idea
